    <h3>Missing something? Probably due to Fay’s need to swipe shinny things! A rogue at heart with the blessing of the moon, Fay is a well honoured druid. With many years of battle and exploration, this elf is a master of their crafts.</h3>
    <p>Born over a 200 years ago in the land of the Large Redwoods. Fay has been crafting their place in the world since leaving home at 50. Befriending creatures big and small throughout the realms. As Fay has traveled, they have become recognized not only for their versatility in battle, but also for their kindness for the daily woes.</p>
    <p>While there are many realms trying to arrange for Fay to come to help their causes, Fay has grown found of the realm “Earth” and all the creatures that populate this realm. Here the battles are not as big or bloody, but still Fay fights for the well-being of the creatures here. Using their rogue-ish skills and shapeshifting abilities they challenge the dominate species and try to save as many innocent souls as possible.</p>
    <p>If you have a cause that you think Fay Blue would be of key assistance for, please contact Damania Slateheart in the middle realm.</p>
    <p id ="tinytext">*Please note that causes within the realm “Earth” will be of most interest to Fay Blue.</p>
